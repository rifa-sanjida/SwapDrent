        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>SwapDonateRent was created with a simple mission: to reduce waste and build stronger communities by making it easy to share resources. We believe that every item deserves a second chance, and every community can benefit from sharing what they have.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>We provide a platform where people can:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-position: inside; margin-top: 1rem;">
            <li><strong>Swap</strong> items they no longer need for things they want</li>
            <li><strong>Donate</strong> items to people who can use them</li>
            <li><strong>Rent</strong> out items to earn extra income</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2025, SwapDonateRent began as a university Python lab project by me and my four friends.
We built it to make swapping, donating, and renting easier â€” and to turn a small idea into something meaningful. </p>
